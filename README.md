# Movie_Recommender_System in R
In this project 2 datasets are being combined and used that have about 90000 rows. First dataset gives us information about User ID, Movie ID and rating given by user to the movie. Second dataset used for this project conatins information about Movie ID and title of the movie. 
We have then joined the dataset using dyplr package and combined the two datasets into one dataframe. Final dataframe is then converted into realRatingMatrix and frequency of ratings are calculated. Using Recommender registry, we list algorithms available for building our movie recommender system. In this project, we have first used SVD, UBCF, IBCF, popular algorithms with split scheme technique. Then we have used the same algorithms with cross validation technique. Based on predictive accuracy, we could use either SVD or POPULAR techniques to generate recommendations because they have the lowest prediction errors and for making recommendation in this project, we have used SVD.
